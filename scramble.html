    <h1>A Javascript Word Scramble Game</h1>

        function randomIndex(list) {
            var index = Math.trunc(Math.random() * list.length);
            // parseInt(float) removes everything after the decimal point
            // JS has no int type so it's technically still a float
            // parseInt is built in, so you don't have to use the Math library
            // var index = parseInt(Math.random() * list.length); would also work
            return index;

            var scrambled_word = SCRAMBLED[index];

            // prompt the user to guess the original word when given the scrambled word

            // If the user guesses the correct word, congratulate them.
            if (guess === secret_word) {
                alert('Congratulations on guessing the correct word!');

            // If the user guesses wrong, tell them they were wrong and the right word.
            } else {
                alert("You guessed " + guess + ". The correct word was: " + secret_word);
            }

            playing = confirm("Press OK To keep playing or Cancel to quit");
        }

        alert("goodbye!");

        // What does confirm() return?
        // Displays an alert message asking the user to press either OK or Cancel,
        // and returns a boolean value.

        // What does setting the playing variable do?
        // Initiates and deactivates the while loop. Initially set to true, user plays, then, when user ends the game, the value becomes false, and the while
        // loop exits.
